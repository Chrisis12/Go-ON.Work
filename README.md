# Go-ON.Work

In Indonesia, informal work is a huge part of the economy. We both have maids and a driver, and through conversations, we heard stories about informal workers being taken advantage of—whether through unfair wages, lack of job security, or exploitative conditions. This inspired us to create Go-On Work, a platform that helps informal workers find better job opportunities while ensuring transparency and fairness.

Go-On Work connects informal workers—such as laborers, drivers, and maids—with employers looking to hire. Workers can browse job listings, apply with one click, and build credibility through employer ratings. Employers can post jobs, review applicants, and rate workers after a job is completed. The app also includes a community feature, allowing workers to connect, share advice, and warn each other about unreliable employers. 

While we have built a strong MVP, we have big plans for the future:  

- Better job-matching algorithms to connect workers with the best opportunities.  
- Employer verification to prevent scams and ensure credibility.  
- More language support to expand accessibility.  
- Stronger worker protections, like reporting features and legal support resources.
